# Chinese-Tokenisation-for-Dummies

This package serves as a wrapper for Jieba and NLTK, aiming to provide an one-command-line solution to Chinese tokenisations. I plan to include options to choose between several packages and different output formats, i.e. csv, separated txt files etc.

As as today, I have written nothing but this very README page.

I might or might not finish it in the near future...
